# Task Tracker

Simple Task Tracker. Runs locally via [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).\
I followed [this react-tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8) by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) and then started to implement my own ideas afterwards.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\
Install serve (npm i -g serve) and then run the app with `serve -s`.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run server`

Run this in a separate terminal. \
Runs json-server locally on port 5000. The Host is the device's IP the server is running on, so it responds if you test the website on other devices.\
Look into package.json to configure the command.
